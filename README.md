# SkwnFrontendDev-1b-PeterIskandar
Frontend technical test by Sekawan Media, from design only https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Trrwk1-pwmgTMwV9hufCb_KjmbE5u848, all built using HTML and CSS.

Since the design is based on mobile view, i made it for mobile viewport only without any desktop compatibility in mind
